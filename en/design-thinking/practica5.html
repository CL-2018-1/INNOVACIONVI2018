This type of security system is aimed at both homes and young people who have a smartphone, because it focuses on the protection of these. The current systems are connected to the internet network and GPS, all by technology. In this case it is presented a mini-alarm of autonomous operation to avoid failures due to satellite network failure, internet and electrical network.</p>
