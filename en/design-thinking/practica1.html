"Design thinking" is presented as a methodology to develop innovation focused on people, offering a lens through which you can observe challenges, detect needs and, finally, solve them. </p>

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">
<p> The five established stages are carried out as a team applying each of the techniques learned in each stage during the process: </ p>
                    <p> • Discover (Empathize). </ p>
                        First stage: use two techniques. </ P>
                            <p> 1) Technique of What? How? Why? </ P>
                            <p> 2) Interview technique </ p>
                                <p> a) Brainstorming </ p>
                                <p> b) Tips: Ask why, encourage stories, pay attention to gestures and body language, do not be afraid of silence, do not suggest answers, ask neutral questions, do not ask binary questions, stimulate conversation, ask a question for see, take a tape recorder or video recorder, ask for consent, prepare a suitable site. </ p>
                    <p> • Interpret (Define). </ p>
                    <p> • Idear (Idear). </ p>

2. They know each of the stages of Design Thinking.</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">
<p> It is a process of 5 phases which are:
                    <p> • Empathize: <p> It is the basis of the design process, it is about putting yourself in the shoes of the person for whom you are designing and empathizing in their way of thinking and feeling, you must immerse yourself in their mind and heart to understand his physical and emotional needs, who is he ?, what does he do ?, what does he like ?, what is important to him ?, why does he do it that way?
                    <p> • Define: <p> Here we process what we learned from the user in phase one and define our opportunities for innovation, we must design a point of view or starting point this is built from the hunches of our user.
                    <p> • Idear: <p> At this stage all the ideas are valid, the evaluation will come later, now the most important thing is to generate as many ideas as possible, for example with a brainstorming that is the technique par excellence to generate ideas, the best of this technique is that it drives collective thinking through conversation, listening and building on other ideas must be allowed to collide and complement each other.
                    <p> • Prototype: <p> Here we create tangible elements such as images, artefacts, models, storyborard or simulated activities such as scketch that allow us to approve our ideas, interact with them, debate, and approach the final solution. A prototype allows us to fail cheaply, fail quickly and fail often until we find the path we are looking for, and we can develop different ideas without having to compromise with any.
                    <p> • Test: <p> In this phase it is important to remember everything you learned during the process, to order it and use it to improve the prototype. To achieve a human-oriented innovation your final product must be evaluated according to three well-articulated components, desirability on the part of the user, feasibility to do it for those who carry it out and functionality is to say if the improvements are aimed at solve the need effectively and finally prepare a high impact communication campaign to stimulate the acceptance of users and entities that want to invest in the project.

                    <p class = "think__details__info__cont"> <p>
                    <p> • Technique of What? How? Why?
                       <p> o It consists in dividing a blackboard into three sections, in the first note that is what your consumer does, in the second section he placed how he does it and finally why this happens.
                    <p> • Interview technique
                        <p> o Prepare the interview: There is nothing better than a sincere and pleasant conversation with your consumer to get to know him. To do this, prepare the interview, gather your team and do a brainstorming of questions, on a whiteboard write on poustip all the potential questions that come to mind afterwards, sort them by themes so that they can be grouped together in order to structure the interview making it more fluid , friendly and effective.
